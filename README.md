## 📖 Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive data visualization dashboard built using **Tableau** to analyze Airbnb data. The goal of this analysis is to provide actionable insights into pricing trends, customer preferences, and property performance across different regions. 

By leveraging historical hosting data, this dashboard helps real estate investors and hosts understand the factors that drive higher ratings and pricing power.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

The short-term rental market is highly competitive. Hosts and investors need data-driven answers to questions such as:
- *Which neighborhoods command the highest prices?*
- *How does the number of bedrooms correlate with price?*
- *What is the trend of host registrations over the years?*
- *Which regions have the best review scores?*

This project tackles these questions by transforming raw data into an interactive visual story.
